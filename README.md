# 🩺 Healthcare Backend System (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

## 📘 Overview
This project is a backend system for a **Healthcare Application**, built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT authentication**.  
It allows users to register, log in, and securely manage **patients**, **doctors**, and **patient-doctor mappings** through RESTful API endpoints.

This project is an implementation of the *Healthcare Backend Assignment* that originally required Django and PostgreSQL, but has been developed using Node.js and MongoDB.

# 📽️ API Testing with Postman

The following video demonstrates how each API endpoint of the Healthcare Backend project is tested using Postman.
It covers:

🔐 User Registration and Login (JWT Authentication)

👨‍⚕️ Doctor Management (CRUD Operations)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Patient Management (CRUD Operations)

🔗 Patient–Doctor Mappings (Assigning, Fetching, and Deleting Relations)
